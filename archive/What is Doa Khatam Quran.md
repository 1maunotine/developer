It is a sunnah (recommended) practice that is based on the example of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions.
  
According to a hadith (narration) reported by Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), he said:

(Sunan Ibn Majah)
  
Another hadith reported by Ad-Darimi states:

> "Whoever recites the Quran (completes it) and then supplicates, four thousand angels will say 'Ameen' to his supplication."

(Sunan Ad-Darimi)

## What are the Benefits of Doa Khatam Quran?
  
Doa Khatam Quran has many benefits and virtues for those who recite it sincerely and humbly. Some of them are:
  
- It is a means of attaining Allah's mercy, as He says in the Quran: "And when you have completed the recitation, then seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed. Indeed, it is a great mercy from your Lord." (Quran 17:82)
- It is a means of attaining Allah's forgiveness, as He says in the Quran: "And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times. And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, 'We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.' And thus We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (the Quran). And those whom We gave the Scripture before it - they believe in it. And when it is recited to them, they say: 'We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were, before it, Muslims [submitting to Allah].' Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and [because] they avert evil through good, and from what We have provided them they spend. And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say: 'For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds 0f148eb4a0
